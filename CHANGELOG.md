## [0.22.0] - 2022-06-20

With this release, subxt can subscribe to the node's runtime upgrades to ensure that the metadata is updated and
extrinsics are properly constructed.

We have also made some slight API improvements to make in the area of storage keys, and thanks to an external contribution we now support dry running transactions before submitting them.

This release also improves the documentation, adds UI tests, and defaults the `subxt-cli` to return metadata
bytes instead of the JSON format.

### Fixed

- Handle `StorageEntry` empty keys ([#565](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/565))
- Fix documentation examples ([#568](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/568))

## [0.21.0] - 2022-05-02

This release adds static metadata validation, via comparing the statically generated API with the target node's runtime
metadata. This implies a breaking change in the subxt API, as the user receives an error when interacting with an
incompatible API at the storage, call, and constant level.

The `subxt-cli` can check the compatibility of multiple runtime nodes, either full metadata compatibility or
compatibility at the pallet level.

Users can define custom derives for specific generated types of the API via adding the `derive_for_type` configuration
to the `subxt` attribute.

The metadata documentation is propagated to the statically generated API.

Previously developers wanting to build the subxt crate needed the `substrate` binary dependency in their local
environment. This restriction is removed via moving the integration tests to a dedicated crate.

The number of dependencies is reduced for individual subxt crates.

### Fixed
- test-runtime: Add exponential backoff ([#518](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/518))

### Added

- Add custom derives for specific generated types ([#520](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/520))
- Static Metadata Validation ([#478](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/478))
- Propagate documentation to runtime API ([#511](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/511))

- Add system health rpc ([#510](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/510))

### Changed
- Put integration tests behind feature flag ([#515](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/515))
- Use minimum amount of dependencies for crates ([#524](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/524))
- Export `BaseExtrinsicParams` ([#516](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/516))
- bump jsonrpsee to v0.10.1 ([#504](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/504))

## [0.20.0] - 2022-04-06

The most significant change in this release is how we create and sign extrinsics, and how we manage the
"additional" and "extra" data that is attached to them. See https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/issues/477, and the
associated PR https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/490 for a more detailed look at the code changes.

If you're targeting a node with compatible additional and extra transaction data to Substrate or Polkadot, the main
change you'll have to make is to import and use `subxt::PolkadotExtrinsicParams` or `subxt::SubstrateExtrinsicParams`
instead of `subxt::DefaultExtra` (depending on what node you're compatible with), and then use `sign_and_submit_default`
instead of `sign_and_submit` when making a call. Now, `sign_and_submit` accepts a second argument which allows these
parameters (such as mortality and tip payment) to be customized. See `examples/balance_transfer_with_params.rs` for a
small usage example.

If you're targeting a node which involves custom additional and extra transaction data, you'll need to implement the
trait `subxt::extrinsic::ExtrinsicParams`, which determines the parameters that can be provided to `sign_and_submit`, as
well as how to encode these into the "additional" and "extra" data needed for a transaction. Have a look at
`subxt/src/extrinsic/params.rs` for the trait definition and Substrate/Polkadot implementations. The aim with this change
is to make it easier to customise this for your own chains, and provide a simple way to provide values at runtime.
